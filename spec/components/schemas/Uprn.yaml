title: UPRN
type: string
description: >-
  UPRN stands for Unique Property Reference Number and was created by the Ordnance Survey (OS). Local governments in the UK have allocated a unique number for each land or property.
  Up to 12 digits in length.
  Although UPRN takes an integer format, we encode and transmit this data as strings. As a 12 digit number, it can potentially be more than 32 bits which can be problematic for some languages and databases which are expecting 32 bit integers.
examples:
  - "906700131855"
  - "100120045112"
  - "10091004080"
  - ""
