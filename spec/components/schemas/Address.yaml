  postcode:
    type: string
    description: Correctly formatted postcode. Capitalised and spaced.
  postcode_inward:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The second part of a postcode is known as the inward code. e.g. The inward
      code of ID1 1QD is 1QD. This part is one number followed by two letters.
      The number identifies the sector in the postal district. The letters then
      define one or more properties in that sector.
  postcode_outward:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The first part of a postcode is known as the outward code. e.g. The
      outward code of ID1 1QD is ID1. Enables mail to be sorted to the correct
      local area for delivery. This part of the code contains the area and the
      district to which the mail is to be delivered, e.g. ‘PO1’, ‘SW1A’ or
      ‘B23’.
  post_town:
    maxLength: 30
    type: string
    description: >-
      A Post Town is mandatory for delivery of mail to a Delivery Point. This is
      not necessarily the nearest town geographically, but a routing instruction
      to the Royal Mail delivery office sorting mail for that Delivery Point. A
      Post Town will always be present in every address, and for some Localities
      the Post Town will be the only locality element present.
  dependent_locality:
    maxLength: 35
    type: string
    description: >-
      When the same thoroughfare name reoccurs in a Post town, it may not be
      possible to make it dependant on a dependant thoroughfare. In this case
      the thoroughfare is dependant on a locality. For example if we want to
      find 1 Back Lane in Huddersfield we see that there are three.
  double_dependent_locality:
    maxLength: 35
    type: string
    description: >-
      Used to supplement Dependant Locality. A Double Dependant Locality
      supplied along with a Dependant Locality if the Dependant Locality exists
      twice in the same locality.
  thoroughfare:
    maxLength: 80
    type: string
    description: >-
      Also known as the street or road name. In general each Thoroughfare Name
      will have a separate Postcode. Longer Thoroughfares with high number
      ranges often have multiple Postcodes covering the entire length of the
      road, with breaks at suitable points e.g. junctions or natural breaks in
      the road.
  dependent_thoroughfare:
    maxLength: 80
    type: string
    description: >-
      Used to supplement thoroughfare. When a thoroughfare name is used twice in
      the same Post Town, the dependant thoroughfare is added to uniquely
      indentify a delivery point.
  building_number:
    maxLength: 4
    type: string
    description: Number to identify premise on a thoroughfare or dependant thoroughfare.
  building_name:
    maxLength: 50
    type: string
    description: >-
      Name of residential or commercial premise. E.g. The Manor, 1-2, A, 12A, K,
      Victoria House
  sub_building_name:
    maxLength: 30
    type: string
    description: >-
      When a premise is split into individual units such as flats, apartments or
      business units. Cannot be present without either building_name or
      building_number. E.g. Flat 1, A, 10B
  po_box:
    type: string
    description: >-
      When the PO Box Number field is populated it will contain PO BOX nnnnnn
      where n represents the PO Box number. Note that the PO Box details can
      occasionally consist of a combination of numbers and letters e.g. HK860.
      PO Box Numbers are only allocated to Large Users.
  department_name:
    maxLength: 60
    type: string
    description: >-
      Used to supplment Organisation Name to identify a deparment within the
      organisation.
  organisation_name:
    maxLength: 60
    type: string
    description: Name of the organisation registered at this address.
  udprn:
    type: integer
    description: >-
      UDPRN stands for ‘Unique Delivery Point Reference Number’. Royal Mail
      assigns a unique UDPRN code for each premise on PAF. Simple, unique
      reference number for each Delivery Point. Unlikely to be reused when an
      address expires. Up to 8-digit numeric code. A new UDPRN is automatically
      assigned to each new Delivery Point added to PAF.
    format: int32
  umprn:
    type: string
    description: >-
      A small minority of individual premises (as identified by a UDPRN) may
      have multiple occupants behind the same letterbox. These are known as
      Multiple Residence occupants and can be queried via the Multiple Residence
      dataset. Simple, unique reference number for each Multiple Residence
      occupant. 8-character numeric code. Note: this will be an empty string
      when not used for legacy reasons
  postcode_type:
    $ref: '#/components/schemas/PostcodeType'
  su_organisation_indicator:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Small User Organisation Indicator can have the values 'Y' or space. A
      value of 'Y' indicates that a Small User Organisation is present at this
      address.
  delivery_point_suffix:
    type: string
    description: >-
      A unique Royal Mail 2-character code (the first numeric & the second
      alphabetical), which, when added to the Postcode, enables each live
      Delivery Point to be uniquely identified. Once the Delivery Point is
      deleted from PAF the DPS may be reused (although they aren’t reused until
      all remaining Delivery Points in the range have been allocated). The DPS
      for a Large User is always '1A' as each Large User has its own Postcode.
      E.g. 2B
  line_1:
    type: string
    description: >-
      First Address Line. Often contains premise and thoroughfare information.
      In the case of a commercial premise, the first line is always the full
      name of the registered organisation. Never empty.
  line_2:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Second Address Line. Often contains thoroughfare and locality information.
      May be empty.
  line_3:
    type: string
    description: Third address line. May be empty.
  premise:
    maxLength: 84
    type: string
    description: >-
      A pre-computed string which sensibly combines building_number,
      building_name and sub_building_name. building_number, building_name and
      sub_building_name represent raw data from Royal Mail's and can be
      difficult to parse if you are unaware of how the Postcode Address File
      premise fields work together. For this reason, we also provide a
      pre-computed premise field which intelligently gathers these points into a
      single, simple premise string. This field is ideal if you want to pull
      premise information and thoroughfare information separately instead of
      using our address lines data.
  country:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The country for which the postcode belongs to. May be empty for a small
      number of addresses. Data source: ONS
  county:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Since postal, administrative or traditional counties may not apply to some
      addresses, the county field is designed to return whatever county data is
      available. Normally, the postal county is returned. If this is not
      present, the county field will fall back to the administrative county. If
      the administrative county is also not present, the county field will fall
      back to the traditional county. May be empty in cases where no
      administrative, postal or traditional county present.
  administrative_county:
    type: string
    description: >-
      The current administrative county to which the postcode has been assigned.
      A Unitary Authority name, where one is present. If there is no Unitary
      Authority, the County name is used. This information is not static,
      because County boundaries may change due to administrative changes. Data
      source: ONS. May be empty.
  postal_county:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Postal counties were used for the distribution of mail before the Postcode
