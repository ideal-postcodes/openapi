type: string
minLength: 2
maxLength: 2
description: >-
  A unique Royal Mail 2-character code (the first numeric & the second
  alphabetical), which, when added to the Postcode, enables each live
  Delivery Point to be uniquely identified. Once the Delivery Point is
  deleted from PAF the DPS may be reused (although they arenâ€™t reused until
  all remaining Delivery Points in the range have been allocated). The DPS
  for a Large User is always '1A' as each Large User has its own Postcode.
examples:
  - 1A
  - 2J
  - 2U
