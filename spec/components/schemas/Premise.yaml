title: Premise
maxLength: 84
type: string
description: >-
  A pre-computed string which sensibly combines building_number,
  building_name and sub_building_name. building_number, building_name and
  sub_building_name represent raw data from Royal Mail's and can be
  difficult to parse if you are unaware of how the Postcode Address File
  premise fields work together. For this reason, we also provide a
  pre-computed premise field which intelligently gathers these points into a
  single, simple premise string. This field is ideal if you want to pull
  premise information and thoroughfare information separately instead of
  using our address lines data.
examples:
  - "10"
  - Flat, 10
  - Flat 8, 8
