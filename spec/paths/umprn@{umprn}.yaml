    ### Lookup a UMPRN


    Returns an address identified via its UMPRN.


    ### Testing


    To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UMPRNs that
    yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request. They are
    the following:


    To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UMPRNs that
    yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request. They are
    the following


    - `0` Returns a successful UMPRN lookup response `2000`

    - `-1` Returns "UMPRN not found", error `4044`

    - `-2` Returns "no lookups remaining", error `4020`

    - `-3` Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached", error `4021`


    Test requests will undergo usual authentication and restriction rules
    (individual and daily lookup limits) to surface any problems you may have
    during implementation. However, it will not count towards a postcode lookup
    on your key.


    ### Pricing


    Per lookup charges apply. Empty responses are not charged.
