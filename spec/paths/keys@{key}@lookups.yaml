    Returns a CSV download of lookups performed and associated information.


    Note that the `Content-Type` returned will be CSV (text/csv). For a non 200

    response, the `Content-Type` will revert to JSON with the error code and

    message embedded.


    This method requires a `user_token`, which can be found on your [accounts
    page](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/account).


    A maximum interval of 90 days can be provided for analysis. If no start or
    end date is provided, the last 21 days will be used as the default interval.


    ### GDPR Update


    After May 2018, the API will begin to redact IP Address, Search Term and URL
    data that is older than 28 days from our stores on a weekly basis as part of
    our new data protection strategy. This means the aforementioned data points
    will no longer be retrievable from this API if it is more than 28 days old.


    Reach out to us by [mail](<mailto:support@ideal-postcodes.co.uk>) or
    [chat](https://chat.ideal-postcodes.co.uk) if you would like to modify this
    28 day window or prefer this data not be collected at all.
