    ### Returns an address identified via its UDPRN.


    You may find it useful to store UDPRN information as it can be used to
    retrieve the most recent information for an address. It can also be used to
    test for a "decommissioned" address.


    ### Testing


    To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UDPRNs that
    yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request. They are
    the following:


    - `0` Returns a successful UDPRN lookup response `2000`

    - `-1` Returns "UDPRN not found", error `4044`

    - `-2` Returns "no lookups remaining", error `4020`

    - `-3` Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached", error `4021`


    Test requests will undergo usual authentication and restriction rules
    (individual and daily lookup limits) to surface any problems you may have
    during implementation. However, it will not count towards a postcode lookup
    on your key.


    ### Pricing


    Per lookup charges apply. Empty responses are not charged.

        UDPRNs are an eight digit unique numeric code (e.g. 25962203) for any
        premise on the Postcode Address File. It's essentially a unique
        identifier for every address in the UK that Royal Mail has in its
        database.
