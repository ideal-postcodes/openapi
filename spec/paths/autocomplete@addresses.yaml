  summary: Address Autocomplete
  description: |
    Use `/autocomplete` to implement Address Finder functionality by retrieving address suggestions for a partial string.

    ### Implementing Autocomplete

    Retrieving addresses using autocomplete is a 2 step process.

    1. Retrieve partial address suggestions via `/autocomplete/addresses`
    2. Retrieve the entire address by following the URL provided by the
    suggestion

    Step 2 will decrement your lookup balance.

    Please note, this API is [not intended to be a free standalone resource](#pricing).

    ### Testing

    `ID1 1QD` will return address suggestions, that when retrieved via `/udprn/:id` will not affect your balance.

    ### Notes

    #### Suggestion Format

    The suggestion format is prone to change over time. Attempts to parse the suggestion may result in your integration breaking. Instead use the suggestion as is.

    #### Querying with a Postcode

    If a postcode is passed as a query, all addresses for that postcode will be listed as the result if the limit parameter is not supplied. If a postcode forms only part of the query, your autocomplete results will be filtered by that postcode.

    #### Querying Multiple Residence

    For Multiple Residence enabled keys, any Multiple Residence households will also return a UMPRN id, which can be retrieved with the `/umprn/` endpoint.  Note that Multiple Residence households will always have a parent premise with a UDPRN, and a single UDPRN premise may have many Multiple Residence households with different UMPRNs. For instance:

    ```
    {
      "result": {
        "hits": [
          {
            "suggestion": "10 Downings, London, E6",
            "urls": {
              "udprn": "/v1/udprn/7944730"
            },
            "udprn": 7944730
          },
          {
            "suggestion": "10 Downing Grove, Hull, HU9",
            "urls": {
              "udprn": "/v1/udprn/11168744",
              "umprn": "/v1/umprn/882919"
            },
            "udprn": 11168744,
            "umprn": 882919
          }
        ]
      },
      "code": 2000,
      "message": "Success"
    }

    ```

    ### Rate Limiting

    You can make up to 3000 requests to the autocomplete API within a 5 minute span. The HTTP Header contains information on your current rate limit.


    | Header                  | Description | 
    | -- | -- |
    | `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that can be made in 5 minutes                           |
    | `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The remaining requests within the current rate limit window                            |
    | `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time when the rate limit window resets in Unix Time (seconds) or UTC Epoch seconds |

    ### Pricing

    This API currently does not affect your balance. However, subsequent searches require a paid request (e.g. a UDPRN search). This paid request, will yield the complete address.  

    Please note, this API is not intended as a standalone free resource.  Integrations that consistently make autocomplete requests without a paid request to resolve an address may be disrupted via tightened rate limits.  Continued misuse will result in account suspension.
