  summary: lookupUDPRN
  description: >
    Returns an address identified via its Unique Delivery Point Reference 

    Number (UDPRN).


    You may find it useful to store UDPRN information as it can be used to 

    retrieve the most recent information for an address. It can also be used 

    to test for a "decommissioned" address.


    UDPRNs are an eight digit unique numeric code (e.g. 25962203) for any 

    premise on the Postcode Address File. It's essentially a unique identifier 

    for every address in the UK that Royal Mail has in its database.


    ### Testing


    To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UDPRNs 

    that yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request. 

    They are the following


    - <code>0</code> Returns a successful UDPRN lookup response
    <code>2000</code>

    - <code>-1</code> Returns "UDPRN not found", error <code>4044</code>

    - <code>-2</code> Returns "no lookups remaining", error <code>4020</code>

    - <code>-3</code> Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached",
    error <code>4021</code>


    Test requests will undergo usual authentication and restriction rules (

    individual and daily lookup limits) to surface any problems you may have 

    during implementation. However, it will not count towards a postcode 

    lookup on your key.


    ### Pricing


    Per lookup charges apply. Empty responses are not charged.
