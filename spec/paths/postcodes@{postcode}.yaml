  summary: Retrieve Addresses for a Postcode
  description: >
    Returns the complete list of addresses for a postcode.


    Postcode searches are space and case insensitive.


    ### Postcode not found


    Please note: For postcodes that do not exist, your key is not charged, the
    API returns a 404 response with a response body


    ```

    {
      "code": 4040,
      "message": "Postcode not found"
    }

    ```


    ### Testing


    To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test postcodes
    that yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request. They
    are the following:


    - `ID1 1QD` Returns a successful postcode lookup response `2000`

    - `ID1 KFA` Returns "postcode not found", error `4040`

    - `ID1 CLIP` Returns "no lookups remaining", error `4020`

    - `ID1 CHOP` Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached", error
    `4021`


    Test requests will undergo usual authentication and restriction rules
    (individual and daily lookup limits) to surface any problems you may have
    during implementation. However, it will not count towards a postcode lookup
    on your key.


    ### Multiple Residence Dataset & Pagination


    For keys which use the Multiple Residence dataset, there are a small number
    of postcodes which yield more than Royal Mail's maximum allowed return (of
    100 addresses) per request. Multiple Residence data users have the option of
    paginating postcode queries if the limit is reached.
