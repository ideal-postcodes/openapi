        An comma separated list of tags you wish to query for. This is useful if
        you want to specify the circumstances in which the request was made. If
        multiple tags are specified, the analysed dataset will only comprise of
        requests for which all the tags are satisfied - i.e. searching `foo,bar`
        will only query requests which tagged both `'foo'` and `'bar'`.
