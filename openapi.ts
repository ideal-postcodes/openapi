     * The Postcode Lookup API provides a JSON interface to search UK addresses from a postcode. It can be used to power Postcode Lookup driven address searches, like [Postcode Lookup](/postcode-lookup).
     *
     * ## Postcode Not Found
     *
     * Lookup balance is unaffected by invalid postcodes. The API returns a `404` response with response body:
     *
     * ```json
     * {
     *   "code": 4040,
     *   "message": "Postcode not found",
     *   "suggestions": ["SW1A 0AA"]
     * }
     * ```
     *
     * ### Suggestions
     *
     * If a postcode cannot be found, the API will provide up to 5 closest matching postcodes. Common errors will be corrected first (e.g. mixing up `O` and `0` or `I` and `1`).
     *
     * If the suggestion list is small (fewer than 3), there is a high probability the correct postcode is there. You may notify the user or immediately trigger new searches.
     *
     * The suggestion list will be empty if the postcode has deviated too far from a valid postcode format.
     *
     * ## Multiple Residence
     *
     * A small number of postcodes will return more than 100 premises. These may require pagination. Use `page` to paginate the result set.

  "/cleanse/addresses": {

     * The address cleanse API attempts to return the closest matching address for any given address inputs. We also return a number of Match Level indicators that describe the degree to which the suggested address matches the input address. The more impaired the input address, the harder it is to cleanse.
     *
     * ## Confidence Score
     *
     * The confidence score is a number ranging between 0 and 1. Where 1 implies a full match and 0 implies no major elements completely match. Each incorrect, missing or misspelled element will subtract from the overall confidence score.
     *
     * ### Deciding on an Acceptable Confidence Score Threshold
     *
     * Different address cleanse projects can have radically different inputs. However, within each project, the inputs tend to repeat the same errors. For instance, some input datasets may be exclusively inputted manually and be prone to typos. Others may have a persistently missing datapoint such as organisation name or postcode. For this reason, it is important to understand that there is no absolute Confidence Score threshold. Instead, the acceptable confidence score must be determined on a project by project basis based on systematic errors present in the data and business goals.
     *
     * When determining an acceptable Confidence Score threshold you should load a subset of the dataset into a spreadsheet application like Excel and sort on the score. Scrolling from top-to-bottom you will be able to observe matches from best to worst. As you start to hit the lower quality searches, you will be able to roughly determine:
     *  - Which confidence scores indicate ambiguous matches (i.e. up to building level only)
     * - Which confidence scores indicate a poor or no match (i.e. the nearest matching address is too far from the input address)
     *
     * Depending on your business goals, you can also use the Match Levels to determine an acceptable match. For instance, do you need to match up to the thoroughfare or building name only? Are accurate organisation names an important feature?

    /**
     * The Address Autocomplete API delivers address suggestions in order of relevance based on a provided query. It aids real-time address autofill implementations.
     *
     * Consider using our Address Autocomplete JavaScript libraries to add address lookup to a form in moments rather than interacting with this API directly.
     *
     * ## API Usage
     *
     * Implementing our Address Autocomplete API involves:
     *
     * 1. Fetch address suggestions with `/autocomplete/addresses`
     * 2. Acquire the complete address using the ID from the suggestion
     *
     * Step 2 will decrement your lookup balance.
     *
     * Note that step 1 is not a free standalone resource. Integrations that consistently make autocomplete requests without a paid Step 2 request will be rate limited and then suspended.
     *
     * ## Query Filters
     *
     * Refine results by appending filters to your querystring, e.g., `postcode=sw1a2aa` for postcode `SW1A 2AA`. Invalid filters return an empty set without affecting your lookup count.
     *
     * To apply multiple filter terms, use a comma-separated list, e.g., `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3` combines result sets for E1, E2, and E3. Unless otherwise specified, all filters support multiple terms.
     *
     * Combine filters by `AND` logic, for instance, `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. The maximum allowed filter terms is **10**.
     *
     * ## Address Bias
     *
     * Preface bias searches with `bias_` to boost certain address results. Unlike filters, biasing allows unmatched addresses to appear with lower priority.
     *
     * For example, use `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE` to favor addresses in the `SW` and `SE` postcode areas. Invalid bias terms have no effect.
     *
     * Multiple bias terms are allowed unless stated otherwise, with a combined maximum of **5**.
     *
     * ## Suggestion Format
     *
     * The suggestion format is subject to change. We recommend using the suggestion as-is to prevent potential integration issues.
     *
     * ## Rate Limiting and Cost
     *
     * The rate limit for the Autocomplete API is 3000 requests per 5 minutes. HTTP Headers inform about the current rate limit.
     *
     * Autocomplete API usage does not impact your balance, but resolving a suggestion to a full address requires a paid request. Autocomplete requests without subsequent paid requests may result in rate limitation or suspension.

     *
     * If a valid postcode is passed as the query string, the entire address list for that postcode is passed as a result. Note, in these cases, limit and page parameters are ignored.
     *
     * This API is designed as a multi-purpose tool for generating address lists, cleansing and wholesale data extraction according to specific parameters.

     * For address autocomplete, see our address finder API - which is designed for speed and address completion.

     *
     * Return a list of addresses around a point using the lon= and lat= querystring arguments. Addresses will be sorted in order of distance to the point. The search radius is 100m.
     *
     * ## Filters
     *
     * You can strictly narrow your result by adding filters to your query string which correspond with an address attribute.
     *
     * For instance, you can restrict to postcode `SW1A 2AA` by appending `postcode=sw1a2aa`.
     *
     * If a filter term is invalid, e.g. `postcode=SW1A2AAA`, then an empty result set is returned and no lookup is incurred.
     *
     * You can also scope using multiple terms for the same filter with a comma separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to E1, E2 and E3 outward codes: `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`. Multiple terms are `OR`'ed, i.e. the matching result sets are combined.
     *
     * All filters can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.
     *
     * Multiple filters can also be combined. E.g. Restrict results to small user organisations in the N postcode area: `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. Multiple filters are `AND`'ed, i.e. each additional filter narrows the result set.
     *
     * A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all filters.
     *
     * ## Biases
     *
     * You can boost certain addresses results that correspond with a certain address attribute. All bias searches are prefixed with `bias_`.
     *
     * Biased searches, unlike filtered searches, also allow unmatched addresses to appear . These will rank lower.
     *
     * For instance, you can boost addresses with postcode areas `SW` and `SE` by appending `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE`.
     *
     * If a bias term is invalid, e.g. `bias_postcode=SW1A2AAA` no bias effect is applied.
     *
     * You may scope using multiple terms for the same bias with a comma separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to `E1`, `E2` and `E3` outward codes: `bias_postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`.
     *
     * All biases can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.
     *
     * A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all biases.
     *
     * ## Search by Postcode and Building Name or Number
     *
     * Search by postcode and building attribute with the postcode filter and query argument. E.g. For "SW1A 2AA Prime Minister" `/v1/addresses?postcode=sw1a2aa&q=prime minister`.
     *
     * The advantage of using filters is a postcode mismatch does not result in a lookup as no results are returned.
     *
     * #### Search By UPRN
     *
     * Search by UPRN using the `uprn` filter and excluding the query argument. E.g. `/v1/addresses?uprn=100`.
     *
     * ## Testing
     *
     * - **ID1 1QD** Returns a successful query response `2000`
     * - **ID1 KFA** Returns an empty query response `2000`
     * - **ID1 CLIP** Returns "no lookups remaining" error `4020`
     * - **ID1 CHOP** Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached" error `4021`
     *
     * Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules. This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and does not cost you a lookup.

   * Returns the complete list of addresses for a postcode. Postcode searches are space and case insensitive.
   *
   * The Postcode Lookup API provides a JSON interface to search UK addresses from a postcode. It can be used to power Postcode Lookup driven address searches, like [Postcode Lookup](/postcode-lookup).
   *
   * ## Postcode Not Found
   *
   * Lookup balance is unaffected by invalid postcodes. The API returns a `404` response with response body:
   *
   * ```json
   * {
   *   "code": 4040,
   *   "message": "Postcode not found",
   *   "suggestions": ["SW1A 0AA"]
   * }
   * ```
   *
   * ### Suggestions
   *
   * If a postcode cannot be found, the API will provide up to 5 closest matching postcodes. Common errors will be corrected first (e.g. mixing up `O` and `0` or `I` and `1`).
   *
   * If the suggestion list is small (fewer than 3), there is a high probability the correct postcode is there. You may notify the user or immediately trigger new searches.
   *
   * The suggestion list will be empty if the postcode has deviated too far from a valid postcode format.
   *
   * ## Multiple Residence
   *
   * A small number of postcodes will return more than 100 premises. These may require pagination. Use `page` to paginate the result set.

  /**
   * The address cleanse API attempts to return the closest matching address for any given address inputs. We also return a number of Match Level indicators that describe the degree to which the suggested address matches the input address. The more impaired the input address, the harder it is to cleanse.
   *
   * ## Confidence Score
   *
   * The confidence score is a number ranging between 0 and 1. Where 1 implies a full match and 0 implies no major elements completely match. Each incorrect, missing or misspelled element will subtract from the overall confidence score.
   *
   * ### Deciding on an Acceptable Confidence Score Threshold
   *
   * Different address cleanse projects can have radically different inputs. However, within each project, the inputs tend to repeat the same errors. For instance, some input datasets may be exclusively inputted manually and be prone to typos. Others may have a persistently missing datapoint such as organisation name or postcode. For this reason, it is important to understand that there is no absolute Confidence Score threshold. Instead, the acceptable confidence score must be determined on a project by project basis based on systematic errors present in the data and business goals.
   *
   * When determining an acceptable Confidence Score threshold you should load a subset of the dataset into a spreadsheet application like Excel and sort on the score. Scrolling from top-to-bottom you will be able to observe matches from best to worst. As you start to hit the lower quality searches, you will be able to roughly determine:
   *  - Which confidence scores indicate ambiguous matches (i.e. up to building level only)
   * - Which confidence scores indicate a poor or no match (i.e. the nearest matching address is too far from the input address)
   *
   * Depending on your business goals, you can also use the Match Levels to determine an acceptable match. For instance, do you need to match up to the thoroughfare or building name only? Are accurate organisation names an important feature?

  /**
   * The Address Autocomplete API delivers address suggestions in order of relevance based on a provided query. It aids real-time address autofill implementations.
   *
   * Consider using our Address Autocomplete JavaScript libraries to add address lookup to a form in moments rather than interacting with this API directly.
   *
   * ## API Usage
   *
   * Implementing our Address Autocomplete API involves:
   *
   * 1. Fetch address suggestions with `/autocomplete/addresses`
   * 2. Acquire the complete address using the ID from the suggestion
   *
   * Step 2 will decrement your lookup balance.
   *
   * Note that step 1 is not a free standalone resource. Integrations that consistently make autocomplete requests without a paid Step 2 request will be rate limited and then suspended.
   *
   * ## Query Filters
   *
   * Refine results by appending filters to your querystring, e.g., `postcode=sw1a2aa` for postcode `SW1A 2AA`. Invalid filters return an empty set without affecting your lookup count.
   *
   * To apply multiple filter terms, use a comma-separated list, e.g., `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3` combines result sets for E1, E2, and E3. Unless otherwise specified, all filters support multiple terms.
   *
   * Combine filters by `AND` logic, for instance, `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. The maximum allowed filter terms is **10**.
   *
   * ## Address Bias
   *
   * Preface bias searches with `bias_` to boost certain address results. Unlike filters, biasing allows unmatched addresses to appear with lower priority.
   *
   * For example, use `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE` to favor addresses in the `SW` and `SE` postcode areas. Invalid bias terms have no effect.
   *
   * Multiple bias terms are allowed unless stated otherwise, with a combined maximum of **5**.
   *
   * ## Suggestion Format
   *
   * The suggestion format is subject to change. We recommend using the suggestion as-is to prevent potential integration issues.
   *
   * ## Rate Limiting and Cost
   *
   * The rate limit for the Autocomplete API is 3000 requests per 5 minutes. HTTP Headers inform about the current rate limit.
   *
   * Autocomplete API usage does not impact your balance, but resolving a suggestion to a full address requires a paid request. Autocomplete requests without subsequent paid requests may result in rate limitation or suspension.

  /**
   * Extract a list of complete addresses that match the query ordered by relevance score. This query accepts an optional limit and page query (defaults to 10 and 0 respectively).
   *
   * If a valid postcode is passed as the query string, the entire address list for that postcode is passed as a result. Note, in these cases, limit and page parameters are ignored.
   *
   * This API is designed as a multi-purpose tool for generating address lists, cleansing and wholesale data extraction according to specific parameters.
   *
   * For address autocomplete, see our address finder API - which is designed for speed and address completion.
   *
   * ## Reverse Geocoding
   *
   * Return a list of addresses around a point using the lon= and lat= querystring arguments. Addresses will be sorted in order of distance to the point. The search radius is 100m.
   *
   * ## Filters
   *
   * You can strictly narrow your result by adding filters to your query string which correspond with an address attribute.
   *
   * For instance, you can restrict to postcode `SW1A 2AA` by appending `postcode=sw1a2aa`.
   *
   * If a filter term is invalid, e.g. `postcode=SW1A2AAA`, then an empty result set is returned and no lookup is incurred.
   *
   * You can also scope using multiple terms for the same filter with a comma separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to E1, E2 and E3 outward codes: `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`. Multiple terms are `OR`'ed, i.e. the matching result sets are combined.
   *
   * All filters can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.
   *
   * Multiple filters can also be combined. E.g. Restrict results to small user organisations in the N postcode area: `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. Multiple filters are `AND`'ed, i.e. each additional filter narrows the result set.
   *
   * A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all filters.
   *
   * ## Biases
   *
   * You can boost certain addresses results that correspond with a certain address attribute. All bias searches are prefixed with `bias_`.
   *
   * Biased searches, unlike filtered searches, also allow unmatched addresses to appear . These will rank lower.
   *
   * For instance, you can boost addresses with postcode areas `SW` and `SE` by appending `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE`.
   *
   * If a bias term is invalid, e.g. `bias_postcode=SW1A2AAA` no bias effect is applied.
   *
   * You may scope using multiple terms for the same bias with a comma separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to `E1`, `E2` and `E3` outward codes: `bias_postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`.
   *
   * All biases can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.
   *
   * A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all biases.
   *
   * ## Search by Postcode and Building Name or Number
   *
   * Search by postcode and building attribute with the postcode filter and query argument. E.g. For "SW1A 2AA Prime Minister" `/v1/addresses?postcode=sw1a2aa&q=prime minister`.
   *
   * The advantage of using filters is a postcode mismatch does not result in a lookup as no results are returned.
   *
   * #### Search By UPRN
   *
   * Search by UPRN using the `uprn` filter and excluding the query argument. E.g. `/v1/addresses?uprn=100`.
   *
   * ## Testing
   *
   * - **ID1 1QD** Returns a successful query response `2000`
   * - **ID1 KFA** Returns an empty query response `2000`
   * - **ID1 CLIP** Returns "no lookups remaining" error `4020`
   * - **ID1 CHOP** Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached" error `4021`
   *
   * Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules. This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and does not cost you a lookup.
