    # Getting Started


    ## Overview


    ### Access


    All API methods are either a `GET`, `POST` or `OPTIONS` request.


    The API communicates over both HTTPS and plain HTTP using IPv4 and IPv6.


    We recommend using HTTPS only although HTTP is available.


    We use appropriate HTTP status codes where possible to indicate the request
    status.


    ### Rate Limiting


    Each IP address is rate limited at 30 requests per second. Tripping the rate
    limit will result in a 503 response.


    The autocomplete API also has an additional rate limit.


    If you expect to breach the limit please contact us and we can move you to
    an endpoint with a higher limit.


    ### JSONP


    [JSONP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSONP) requests are supported. Include
    a `callback=` in your request as a query parameter. Your results return
    wrapped in a function designated by your request.


    ## Authentication


    Most requests require an **API key** for authentication. Authenticate by
    passing an `api_key` as part of the query string. For example:


    ```

    api.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/v1/autocomplete/addresses?api_key=iddqd&q=parkside

    ```


    Alternatively, authentication can be transmitted via the `Authorization`
    header using the following scheme:


    ```

    Authorization: api_key="iddqd" [other_key="foo"]

    ```


    ## Versioning


    This API is versioned with a simple prefix in the URL. The current version
    is `/v1/`. We will maintain backwards-compatibility by releasing breaking
    changes under a new version.


    Please note that the following changes are backwards-compatible:


    - Adding new properties to existing API responses

    - Adding new API endpoints

    - Adding new optional request parameters to existing API endpoints

    - Changing the order of properties in existing API responses

    - Changing the autocomplete address suggestion format


    ## Error Handling


    A successful lookup is accompanied with a HTTP status code of 200 and a
    response code of 2000 (found in the body).


    An error has occurred if the HTTP status code is not 200. Errors can range
    from a benign 404 (resource not found) to more urgent errors (your API Key
    ran out of credit, failed authentication, etc).


    ## Testing


    Each new account comes with a free test balance. Contact us if you need more
    for testing and integration.


    ### Community Key


    Our documentation and demos make heavy use of our community key `iddqd`.
    This allows for convenient access for trialing the API.


    Many restrictions on this key are relaxed to allow developers make test
    requests. This key has a limit of 15 lookups per IP address per day as well
    as a daily usage cap. If you hit any limit restrictions, you can continue
    testing the API by creating a key of your own and using our free test
    methods.


    Please be kind with the community key. We're trusting everyone to use it
    responsibly so that other developers may trial the API. Thank you!


    ## Metadata


    Requests that affect your balance may be annotated with arbitrary metadata.
    This data is stored along with your lookup history and can be queried at a
    later date via the API or the dashboard. We call the ability to label your
    requests [tagging](https://docs.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/docs/guides/tags).


    # Response Codes


    The API returns two indicators to help you to determine the status of each
    HTTP request.


    The first is the **HTTP Status**, which is found in the status-line of all
    HTTP requests. The API will return status codes that adhere to HTTP /1.1
    Specifications wherever possible.


    `2XX` status codes indicates success while `4XX` and `5XX` indicate client
    and server errors respectively.


    The second is the **API response code**, which can be found in the `code`
    property of the response body. This code will provide a more specific reason
    if a failure has occurred and can point you in the right direction when
    debugging.


    Please use the glossary of code numbers and HTTP status codes below when
    debugging your requests.


    ## 200 Request Success


    | HTTP Code | API Code | Description                                  |

    | --------- | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |

      The Licensee resource represents an alternate legal End User of our data
      who may not be same entity as the owners of the account.


      The concept of Licensees underpins our sublicensing platform, which allows
      users to license multiple external organisations or individuals to access
      data under the same account.


      Sublicensing is ideal for platform vendors, who provide services to
      multiple clients who in turn each have their own users.
  - name: Configs
    description: >
      The Config resource allows users to assign serialised configuration data
      to API Keys. The payloads assigned to a Config object can later be
      retrieved to dynamically configure your integration.


      Useful if you need to configure your integration remotely rather than
      editing code in situ.

      description: >
        Returns the complete list of addresses for a postcode. Postcode searches
        are space and case insensitive.


        The Postcode Lookup API provides a JSON interface to search UK addresses
        from a postcode. It can be used to power Postcode Lookup driven address
        searches, like [Postcode Lookup](/postcode-lookup).


        ## Postcode Not Found


        Lookup balance is unaffected by invalid postcodes. The API returns a
        `404` response with response body:


        ```json

        {
          "code": 4040,
          "message": "Postcode not found",
          "suggestions": ["SW1A 0AA"]
        }

        ```


        ### Suggestions


        If a postcode cannot be found, the API will provide up to 5 closest
        matching postcodes. Common errors will be corrected first (e.g. mixing
        up `O` and `0` or `I` and `1`).


        If the suggestion list is small (fewer than 3), there is a high
        probability the correct postcode is there. You may notify the user or
        immediately trigger new searches.


        The suggestion list will be empty if the postcode has deviated too far
        from a valid postcode format.


        ## Multiple Residence


        A small number of postcodes will return more than 100 premises. These
        may require pagination. Use `page` to paginate the result set.

      operationId: UDPRN
      description: >-
        Returns an address as identified by its Unique Delivery Point Reference
        Number (UDPRN).


        You may find it useful to store UDPRN information as it can be used to
        retrieve the most recent information for an address. It can also be used
        to test for a deleted address.


        UDPRNs are an eight digit unique numeric code (e.g. 25962203) for any
        premise on the Postcode Address File. It's essentially a unique
        identifier for every address in the UK that Royal Mail has in its
        database.


        ## Testing


        To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UDPRNs
        that yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request.


        They are the following:


        - `0` Returns a successful UDPRN lookup response
          `2000`
        - `-1` Returns "UDPRN not found", error `4044`

        - `-2` Returns "no lookups remaining", error `4020`

        - `-3` Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached",
          error `4021`

        Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules.
        This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and
        does not cost you a lookup.

        ## Testing


        To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UMPRNs
        that yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request.
        They are the following


        - `0` Returns a successful UMPRN lookup response `2000`

        - `-1` Returns "UMPRN not found", error `4044`

        - `-2` Returns "no lookups remaining", error `4020`

        - `-3` Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached", error
        `4021`


        Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules.
        This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and
        does not cost you a lookup.


        ### Pricing


        Per lookup charges apply. Empty responses are not charged.

        By default, PII will be redacted if it is older than 21 days. This
        timeframe can be configured from your dashboard.


        You may prevent PII collection altogether by setting the interval to `0`
        days.

      summary: Find Address
      description: >
        The address autocomplete API returns a list of address suggestions that
        match the query ordered by relevance.


        This API can be used to power realtime address finders, also known as
        address autofill or address autocomplete.


        Consider using our Address Autocomplete JavaScript libraries to add
        address lookup to a form in moments.


        ## Implementing Address Autocomplete


        Rapid address autocompletion using our Address Autocomplete API is a 2
        step process.


        1. Retrieve partial address suggestions via `/autocomplete/addresses`

        2. Retrieve the entire address with the ID provided in the suggestion


        Step 2 will decrement your lookup balance.


        Please note, this API is not intended to be a free standalone resource.


        ## Filters


        You can strictly narrow your result by adding filters to your
        querystring. For instance, you can restrict to postcode `SW1A 2AA` by
        appending `postcode=sw1a2aa`.


        If a filter term is invalid, e.g. `postcode=SW1A2AAA`, then an empty
        result set is returned and no lookup is incurred.


        You can also scope using multiple terms for the same filter with a comma
        separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to E1, E2 and E3 outward
        codes: `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`. Multiple terms are `OR`'ed, i.e. the
        matching result sets are combined.


        All filters can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.


        Filters can also be combined. E.g. Restrict results to small user
        organisations in the N postcode area:
        `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. Multiple filters are
        `AND`'ed, i.e. each additional filter narrows the result set.


        A maximum of **10** terms are allowed across all filters.


        ## Biases


        You can boost certain addresses results that match specific address
        criteria. All bias searches are prefixed with `bias_`.


        Biasing (unlike filtering) also allow unmatched addresses to appear with
        lower precedence.


        For instance, can boost addresses with postcode areas `SW` and `SE` by
        appending `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE`.


        No bias effect applies to bias terms that are invalid. e.g.
        `bias_postcode=SW1A2AAA`


        You may scope using multiple terms for the same bias with a comma
        separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to `E1`, `E2` and `E3`
        outward codes: <code>bias_postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3</code>.


        All biases can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.


        A combined maximum of **5** terms are allowed across all biases.


        ## Suggestion Format


        The suggestion format is prone to change over time. Attempts to parse
        the suggestion may result in your integration breaking. Instead use the
        suggestion as-is.


        ## Rate Limiting


        You can make up to 3000 requests to the autocomplete API within a 5
        minute span. The HTTP Header contains information on your current rate
        limit.


        | Header                  |
        Description                                                                           
        |

        | ----------------------- |
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        |

        | `X-RateLimit-Limit`     | The maximum number of requests that can be
        made in 5 minutes                           |

        | `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | The remaining requests within the current
        rate limit window                            |

        | `X-RateLimit-Reset`     | The time when the rate limit window resets
        in Unix Time (seconds) or UTC Epoch seconds |


        ## Pricing


        This API currently does not affect your balance. However, resolving a
        suggestion into a full address requires a paid request.


        Please note, this API is not intended as a standalone free resource.
        Integrations that consistently make autocomplete requests without a paid
        request to resolve an address may be disrupted via tightened rate
        limits. Continued misuse will result in account suspension.

      summary: Extract Addresses
      description: >
        Extract a list of complete addresses that match the query ordered by
        relevance score. This query accepts an optional limit and page query
        (defaults to 10 and 0 respectively).


        If a valid postcode is passed as the query string, the entire address
        list for that postcode is passed as a result. Note, in these cases,
        limit and page parameters are ignored.


        This API is designed as a multi-purpose tool for generating address
        lists, cleansing and wholesale data extraction according to specific
        parameters.


        For address autocomplete, see our address finder API - which is designed
        for speed and address completion.


        ## Reverse Geocoding


        Return a list of addresses around a point using the lon= and lat=
        querystring arguments. Addresses will be sorted in order of distance to
        the point. The search radius is 100m.


        ## Filters


        You can strictly narrow your result by adding filters to your query
        string which correspond with an address attribute.


        For instance, you can restrict to postcode `SW1A 2AA` by appending
        `postcode=sw1a2aa`.


        If a filter term is invalid, e.g. `postcode=SW1A2AAA`, then an empty
        result set is returned and no lookup is incurred.


        You can also scope using multiple terms for the same filter with a comma
        separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to E1, E2 and E3 outward
        codes: `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`. Multiple terms are `OR`'ed, i.e. the
        matching result sets are combined.


        All filters can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.


        Multiple filters can also be combined. E.g. Restrict results to small
        user organisations in the N postcode area:
        `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. Multiple filters are
        `AND`'ed, i.e. each additional filter narrows the result set.


        A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all filters.


        ## Biases


        You can boost certain addresses results that correspond with a certain
        address attribute. All bias searches are prefixed with `bias_`.


        Biased searches, unlike filtered searches, also allow unmatched
        addresses to appear . These will rank lower.


        For instance, you can boost addresses with postcode areas `SW` and `SE`
        by appending `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE`.


        If a bias term is invalid, e.g. `bias_postcode=SW1A2AAA` no bias effect
        is applied.


        You may scope using multiple terms for the same bias with a comma
        separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to `E1`, `E2` and `E3`
        outward codes: `bias_postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`.


        All biases can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.


        A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all biases.


        ## Search by Postcode and Building Name or Number


        Search by postcode and building attribute with the postcode filter and
        query argument. E.g. For "SW1A 2AA Prime Minister"
        `/v1/addresses?postcode=sw1a2aa&q=prime minister`.


        The advantage of using filters is a postcode mismatch does not result in
        a lookup as no results are returned.


        #### Search By UPRN


        Search by UPRN using the `uprn` filter and excluding the query argument.
        E.g. `/v1/addresses?uprn=100`.


        ## Testing


        - **ID1 1QD** Returns a successful query response `2000`

        - **ID1 KFA** Returns an empty query response `2000`

        - **ID1 CLIP** Returns "no lookups remaining" error `4020`

        - **ID1 CHOP** Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached"
        error `4021`


        Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules.
        This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and
        does not cost you a lookup.

        Multiple Residence premises currently share the same UPRN as the parent
        premise.


        May not be available for a small number of Great Britain addresses due

        Returns empty string "" in these instances.


        Although UPRN takes an integer format, we encode and transmit this data
        as strings. As a 12 digit number, the UPRN can exceed the maximum safe
        integer `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` in most browsers causing this
        datapoint to be corrupted.


        Take special care when storing UPRN. As a 12 digit identifier, you will
        need 64 bits to encode every possible UPRN value. This means
        applications like Excel will corrupt cells containing UPRN values.

            A number associated with the whole building. The building number may
            have a numeric and an alphanumeric component, which are concatenated
            e.g. 2A, or alternatively will have a simple building number or a
            complex building number. The building number always relates to the
            whole building and not a sub-unit within it.

            A complex building number may be one of the following:
              - Dual. Two number separated by '/' e.g. 63/64 = 63, 64
              - Sequence. An odd or even sequence of numbers with lower and upper bound separated by an underscore '_' e.g. `1_5` = 1,3,5 and `2_6` = 2,4,6 
              - Range. A range of consecutive numbers with lower and upper bound separated by a dash '-' e.g. `63-66` = 63, 64, 56, 66
            The building number never appears on a line by itself and can
            prepend Building Group, Primary Thoroughfare or Primary Locality.

            The primary locality refers to the specific place the address is.


            In urban areas, the primary locality can be required to distinguish
            between two thoroughfares of the same name in the same district or
            town. Industrial estates with named thoroughfares are also held as
            localities. In rural areas the primary locality is generally a
            townland name.

            Never present without a primary locality. The secondary locality has
            a wider geographic scope than the primary locality.


            It is the secondary locality therefore which differentiates
            addresses with the same primary locality name within the same
            county.


            Secondary localities are more likely to be required for rural
            addresses.


            Second locality elements which can refer to areas, districts,
            industrial estates, towns, etc


            The secondary locality helps identify where the primary locality is
            located.

            delivery purposes. This includes Dublin Postal Districts "Dublin 1"
            to "Dublin 24".


            The post town is a significant element of the Postal Address,
            however it is not always populated in an address. The official post
            office guide, Eolaí an Phoist4, describes post towns in the
            following manner:


            "A provincial postal address may include the name of a town or
            village several miles distant, with which the addressee has little
            or no connection, and, in some places, especially if this residence
            happens to be near a county boundary, the name of the neighbouring
            county instead of the county in which he actually resides. The
            explanation is that the main mail despatches have to be sent for
            more detailed sub division to certain centres known as POST TOWNS,
            chosen because of their accessibility and convenience."

            geographical and political demarcation. Post County is the County
            associated with the Post Town, not the geographic county in which
            the building is located. The Post County is normally used as part of
            the Postal Address with some exceptions e.g. Dublin Postal Districts
            where the Post County is not used and some Post Towns (e.g.
            Tipperary, Kildare, etc.) that have the same name as the Post

            The seven character Eircode has an A65 F4E2 format. The Eircode is a

            The Eircode is always the last line of a Postal Address generated
            within the state, e.g. if an address has four lines then the Eircode
            will be on its own on Address Line 5. For inbound international mail
            the country name IRELAND should be appended as the last line of the
            Postal Address.

                The NUA field contains `true` when the address is a non-unique
                address, and `false` when it is a unique address.


                Ireland has a very high level of non-unique addresses (NUA),
                i.e. the address does not contain a unique building number or
                name. Approximately 35% of all Irish addresses are non-unique
                which equates to 600,000 addresses.


                The typical example of NUA addressing is where every address in
                a townland is the same. The way that post is delivered is by
                local knowledge of postal delivery personnel of which addressee
                lives in which house.


                N.B. For a NUA address, it is impossible to match to a unique
                record in the ECAD and assign an Eircode.

                residential addresses associated with it.

                - Non-Residential Address Point. This type of address point has
                one or more non-residential address (business, club or other
                organisation) associated with it.

                - Mixed Address Point. This is a special case where the
                residential and non residential addresses in the building are
                essentially the same address. The typical example is a farm
                house on an active farm. It is important to note that this is a
                special case. In general a building with both residential and
                non-residential addresses (e.g. an apartment over a shop) will
                receive two address points, one commercial and one residential,
                and hence two Eircodes.


                Buildings can contain multiple address points of type
