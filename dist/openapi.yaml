  description: |
    ## Getting Started

    All API methods are either a `GET`, `POST` or `OPTIONS` request.

    The API communicates over both HTTPS and plain HTTP using IPv4 and IPv6.

    We recommend using HTTPS only although HTTP is available.

    We use appropriate HTTP status codes where possible to indicate the request status.

    ## OpenAPI Spec

    Our OpenAPI specification is available at:

    - [Github Repository](https://github.com/ideal-postcodes/openapi)
    - [API Reference](https://openapi.ideal-postcodes.co.uk)
    - [OpenAPI v3 JSON File](https://openapi.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/openapi.json)
    - [OpenAPI v3 YAML File](https://openapi.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/openapi.yaml)
    - [NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ideal-postcodes/openapi)

    ## Rate Limiting

    Each IP address is rate limited at 30 requests per second. Tripping the rate limit will result in a 503 response.

    The autocomplete API also has an additional rate limit.

    If you expect to breach the limit please contact us and we can move you to an endpoint with a higher limit.

    ## Authentication

    Most requests require an **API key** for authentication. Authenticate by passing an `api_key` as part of the query string. For example:

    ```
    api.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/v1/autocomplete/addresses?api_key=iddqd&q=parkside
    ```

    Alternatively, authentication can be transmitted via the `Authorization` header using the following scheme:

    ```
    Authorization: api_key="iddqd" [other_key="foo"]
    ```

    ## Versioning

    This API is versioned with a simple prefix in the URL. The current version is `/v1/`. We will maintain backwards-compatibility by releasing breaking changes under a new version.

    Please note that the following changes are backwards-compatible:

    - Adding new properties to existing API responses
    - Adding new API endpoints
    - Adding new optional request parameters to existing API endpoints
    - Changing the order of properties in existing API responses
    - Changing the autocomplete address suggestion format

    ## Error Handling

    A successful lookup is accompanied with a HTTP status code of 200 and a response code of 2000 (found in the body).

    An error has occurred if the HTTP status code is not 200. Errors can range from a benign 404 (resource not found) to more urgent errors (your API Key ran out of credit, failed authentication, etc).

    ## Testing

    Each new account comes with a free test balance. Contact us if you need more for testing and integration.

    ## Metadata

    Requests that affect your balance may be annotated with arbitrary metadata. This data is stored along with your lookup history and can be queried at a later date via the API or the dashboard. We call the ability to label your requests [tagging](https://docs.ideal-postcodes.co.uk/docs/guides/tags).

    ## Response Codes

    The API returns two indicators to help you to determine the status of each HTTP request.

    The first is the **HTTP Status**, which is found in the status-line of all HTTP requests. The API will return status codes that adhere to HTTP /1.1 Specifications wherever possible.

    `2XX` status codes indicates success while `4XX` and `5XX` indicate client and server errors respectively.

    The second is the **API response code**, which can be found in the `code` property of the response body. This code will provide a more specific reason if a failure has occurred and can point you in the right direction when debugging.

      The Licensee resource represents an alternate legal End User of our data who may not be the same entity as the owners of the account.

      The concept of Licensees underpins our sublicensing platform, which allows users to license multiple external organisations or individuals to access data under the same account.

      Sublicensing is ideal for platform vendors, who provide services to multiple clients who in turn each have their own users.
  - name: Configs
    description: |
      The Config resource allows users to assign serialised configuration data to API Keys. The payloads assigned to a Config object can later be retrieved to dynamically configure your integration.

      Useful if you need to configure your integration remotely rather than editing code in situ.

      summary: Lookup Postcode
      operationId: Postcodes
      description: |
        Returns the complete list of addresses for a postcode. Postcode searches are space and case insensitive.

        The Postcode Lookup API provides a JSON interface to search UK addresses from a postcode. It can be used to power Postcode Lookup driven address searches, like [Postcode Lookup](/postcode-lookup).

        ## Postcode Not Found

        Lookup balance is unaffected by invalid postcodes. The API returns a `404` response with response body:

        ```json
        {
          "code": 4040,
          "message": "Postcode not found",
          "suggestions": ["SW1A 0AA"]
        }
        ```

        ### Suggestions

        If a postcode cannot be found, the API will provide up to 5 closest matching postcodes. Common errors will be corrected first (e.g. mixing up `O` and `0` or `I` and `1`).

        If the suggestion list is small (fewer than 3), there is a high probability the correct postcode is there. You may notify the user or immediately trigger new searches.

        The suggestion list will be empty if the postcode has deviated too far from a valid postcode format.

        ## Multiple Residence

        A small number of postcodes will return more than 100 premises. These may require pagination. Use `page` to paginate the result set.

      summary: Retrieve by UDPRN

      description: |
        Returns an address as identified by its Unique Delivery Point Reference Number (UDPRN).

        You may find it useful to store UDPRN information as it can be used to retrieve the most recent information for an address. It can also be used to test for a deleted address.

        UDPRNs are an eight digit unique numeric code (e.g. `25962203`) for any premise on the Postcode Address File. It's essentially a unique identifier for every address in the UK that Royal Mail has in its database.

        ## Testing

        To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UDPRNs that yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request.

        They are the following:

        - `0` Returns a successful UDPRN lookup response
          `2000`
        - `-1` Returns "UDPRN not found", error `4044`
        - `-2` Returns "no lookups remaining", error `4020`
        - `-3` Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached",
          error `4021`

        Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules. This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and does not cost you a lookup.

        ## Testing

        To test your implementation of our API we have a range of test UMPRNs that yield both successful and unsuccessful responses to your request. They are the following

        - `0` Returns a successful UMPRN lookup response `2000`
        - `-1` Returns "UMPRN not found", error `4044`
        - `-2` Returns "no lookups remaining", error `4020`
        - `-3` Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached", error `4021`

        Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules. This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and does not cost you a lookup.

        Reports lookup information on a key for paid lookups.

        This method requires a `user_token`, which can be found on your [accounts page](https://ideal-postcodes.co.uk/account).

        A maximum interval of 90 days can be provided for analysis. If no start or end date is provided, the last 21 days will be used as the default interval.

        ## Download Usage History (CSV)

        `GET /keys/:key/lookups`

        Returns a CSV download of lookups performed and associated information.

        Note that the Content-Type returned will be CSV (text/csv). For a non 200 response, the `Content-Type` will revert to JSON with the error code and message embedded.

        ## Data Redaction

        Personally Identifiable Data (PII) caught in this your usage log (including IP, search term and URL data) will be redacted on a weekly basis.

        By default, PII will be redacted if it is older than 21 days. This timeframe can be configured from your dashboard.

        You may prevent PII collection altogether by setting the interval to `0` days.

      summary: Cleanse Address
      description: |
        The address cleanse API attempts to return the closest matching address for any given address inputs. We also return a number of Match Level indicators that describe the degree to which the suggested address matches the input address. The more impaired the input address, the harder it is to cleanse.

        ## Confidence Score

        The confidence score is a number ranging between 0 and 1. Where 1 implies a full match and 0 implies no major elements completely match. Each incorrect, missing or misspelled element will subtract from the overall confidence score.

        ### Deciding on an Acceptable Confidence Score Threshold

        Different address cleanse projects can have radically different inputs. However, within each project, the inputs tend to repeat the same errors. For instance, some input datasets may be exclusively inputted manually and be prone to typos. Others may have a persistently missing datapoint such as organisation name or postcode. For this reason, it is important to understand that there is no absolute Confidence Score threshold. Instead, the acceptable confidence score must be determined on a project by project basis based on systematic errors present in the data and business goals.

        When determining an acceptable Confidence Score threshold you should load a subset of the dataset into a spreadsheet application like Excel and sort on the score. Scrolling from top-to-bottom you will be able to observe matches from best to worst. As you start to hit the lower quality searches, you will be able to roughly determine:
         - Which confidence scores indicate ambiguous matches (i.e. up to building level only)
        - Which confidence scores indicate a poor or no match (i.e. the nearest matching address is too far from the input address)

        Depending on your business goals, you can also use the Match Levels to determine an acceptable match. For instance, do you need to match up to the thoroughfare or building name only? Are accurate organisation names an important feature?

                    For UK verifications, we recommend omitting this field as county data is unreliable.

                    For USA verifications, this should be the state of the address.

                    If submitting a freeform address verification query, enter the full address. E.g. `query=123 Main St, Springfield, CO, 81073`

                    Otherwise, query can be accompanied with the following address components:
                    - `zip_code`
                    - `city` and `state`

                    If zip_code or `city` and `state` or supplied, please omit this information from query by using it purely for the first address line. E.g. `query=123 Main St`
                  example: 123 Main St, Springfield, CO 81073

      description: |
        The Address Autocomplete API delivers address suggestions in order of relevance based on a provided query. It aids real-time address autofill implementations.

        Consider using our Address Autocomplete JavaScript libraries to add address lookup to a form in moments rather than interacting with this API directly.

        ## API Usage

        Implementing our Address Autocomplete API involves:

        1. Fetch address suggestions with `/autocomplete/addresses`
        2. Acquire the complete address using the ID from the suggestion

        Step 2 will decrement your lookup balance.

        Note that step 1 is not a free standalone resource. Integrations that consistently make autocomplete requests without a paid Step 2 request will be rate limited and then suspended.

        ## Query Filters

        Refine results by appending filters to your querystring, e.g., `postcode=sw1a2aa` for postcode `SW1A 2AA`. Invalid filters return an empty set without affecting your lookup count.

        To apply multiple filter terms, use a comma-separated list, e.g., `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3` combines result sets for E1, E2, and E3. Unless otherwise specified, all filters support multiple terms.

        Combine filters by `AND` logic, for instance, `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. The maximum allowed filter terms is **10**.

        ## Address Bias

        Preface bias searches with `bias_` to boost certain address results. Unlike filters, biasing allows unmatched addresses to appear with lower priority.

        For example, use `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE` to favor addresses in the `SW` and `SE` postcode areas. Invalid bias terms have no effect.

        Multiple bias terms are allowed unless stated otherwise, with a combined maximum of **5**.

        ## Suggestion Format

        The suggestion format is subject to change. We recommend using the suggestion as-is to prevent potential integration issues.

        ## Rate Limiting and Cost

        The rate limit for the Autocomplete API is 3000 requests per 5 minutes. HTTP Headers inform about the current rate limit.

        Autocomplete API usage does not impact your balance, but resolving a suggestion to a full address requires a paid request. Autocomplete requests without subsequent paid requests may result in rate limitation or suspension.

      summary: Extract Addresses
      description: |
        Extract a list of complete addresses that match the query ordered by relevance score. This query accepts an optional limit and page query (defaults to 10 and 0 respectively).

        If a valid postcode is passed as the query string, the entire address list for that postcode is passed as a result. Note, in these cases, limit and page parameters are ignored.

        This API is designed as a multi-purpose tool for generating address lists, cleansing and wholesale data extraction according to specific parameters.

        For address autocomplete, see our address finder API - which is designed for speed and address completion.

        ## Reverse Geocoding

        Return a list of addresses around a point using the lon= and lat= querystring arguments. Addresses will be sorted in order of distance to the point. The search radius is 100m.

        ## Filters

        You can strictly narrow your result by adding filters to your query string which correspond with an address attribute.

        For instance, you can restrict to postcode `SW1A 2AA` by appending `postcode=sw1a2aa`.

        If a filter term is invalid, e.g. `postcode=SW1A2AAA`, then an empty result set is returned and no lookup is incurred.

        You can also scope using multiple terms for the same filter with a comma separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to E1, E2 and E3 outward codes: `postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`. Multiple terms are `OR`'ed, i.e. the matching result sets are combined.

        All filters can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.

        Multiple filters can also be combined. E.g. Restrict results to small user organisations in the N postcode area: `su_organisation_indicator=Y&postcode_area=n`. Multiple filters are `AND`'ed, i.e. each additional filter narrows the result set.

        A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all filters.

        ## Biases

        You can boost certain addresses results that correspond with a certain address attribute. All bias searches are prefixed with `bias_`.

        Biased searches, unlike filtered searches, also allow unmatched addresses to appear . These will rank lower.

        For instance, you can boost addresses with postcode areas `SW` and `SE` by appending `bias_postcode_area=SW,SE`.

        If a bias term is invalid, e.g. `bias_postcode=SW1A2AAA` no bias effect is applied.

        You may scope using multiple terms for the same bias with a comma separated list of terms. E.g. Restrict results to `E1`, `E2` and `E3` outward codes: `bias_postcode_outward=e1,e2,e3`.

        All biases can accept multiple terms unless stated otherwise below.

        A combined maximum of 5 terms are allowed across all biases.

        Search by postcode and building attribute with the postcode filter and query argument. E.g. For "SW1A 2AA Prime Minister" `/v1/addresses?postcode=sw1a2aa&q=prime minister`.

        The advantage of using filters is a postcode mismatch does not result in a lookup as no results are returned.

        #### Search By UPRN

        Search by UPRN using the `uprn` filter and excluding the query argument. E.g. `/v1/addresses?uprn=100`.

        ## Testing

        - **ID1 1QD** Returns a successful query response `2000`
        - **ID1 KFA** Returns an empty query response `2000`
        - **ID1 CLIP** Returns "no lookups remaining" error `4020`
        - **ID1 CHOP** Returns "daily (or individual) lookup limit breached" error `4021`

        Test request undergo the usual authentication and restriction rules. This is to help surface any issues that occur during implementation and does not cost you a lookup.

        Query for geographical places across countries. Each query will return a list of place suggestions, which consists of a place name, descriptive name and id.

        This API returns geographical information such as countries, capitals, administrative areas and more. It is ideal for correctly identifying a place along with any other details like geolocation.

        ## Implementing Place Autocomplete

        Extracting the full information of a place is a 2 step process:

        1. Retrieve place suggestions via /places
        2. Retrieve the entire place with the ID provided in the suggestion

        ## Suggestion Format

        Each place suggestion contains a descriptive name which you can provide to users to uniquely identify a place.

        ## Rate Limiting and Cost

        The rate limit for the Autocomplete API is 3000 requests per 5 minutes. HTTP Headers inform about the current rate limit.

        Autocomplete API usage does not impact your balance, but resolving a suggestion to a full address requires a paid request. Autocomplete requests without subsequent paid requests may result in rate limitation or suspension.

    paf_uprn:
      title: Unique Property Reference Number
      type: string
      description: |-
        UPRN stands for Unique Property Reference Number and is maintained by the Ordnance Survey (OS). Local governments in the UK have allocated a unique number for each land or property.

        Up to 12 digits in length.

        Multiple Residence premises currently share the same UPRN as the parent premise.

        May not be available for a small number of Great Britain addresses due to longer update cycles for Ordnance Survey's AddressBase datasets. Returns empty string "" in these instances.

        Although UPRN takes an integer format, we encode and transmit this data as strings. As a 12 digit number, the UPRN can exceed the maximum safe integer `Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER` in most browsers causing this datapoint to be corrupted.

        Take special care when storing UPRN. As a 12 digit identifier, you will need 64 bits to encode every possible UPRN value. This means applications like Excel will corrupt cells containing UPRN values.

            A number associated with the whole building. The building number may have a numeric and an alphanumeric component, which are concatenated e.g. 2A, or alternatively will have a simple building number or a complex building number. The building number always relates to the whole building and not a sub-unit within it.
            A complex building number may be one of the following:
              - Dual. Two number separated by '/' e.g. 63/64 = 63, 64
              - Sequence. An odd or even sequence of numbers with lower and upper bound separated by an underscore '_' e.g. `1_5` = 1,3,5 and `2_6` = 2,4,6 
              - Range. A range of consecutive numbers with lower and upper bound separated by a dash '-' e.g. `63-66` = 63, 64, 56, 66
            The building number never appears on a line by itself and can prepend Building Group, Primary Thoroughfare or Primary Locality.

            The name of the thoroughfare on which premises are located. It may appear on a line by itself or be appended to either a sub building or building number.

            Addresses with thoroughfares can sometimes have the thoroughfare excluded where a Building Group exists, such as a Retail Centre or Business Park, and the thoroughfare is not part of the Postal Address.

            First locality elements which can refer to areas, districts, industrial estates, towns, etc.

            The primary locality refers to the specific place the address is.

            In urban areas, the primary locality can be required to distinguish between two thoroughfares of the same name in the same district or town. Industrial estates with named thoroughfares are also held as localities. In rural areas the primary locality is generally a townland name.
          example: Cookstown Industrial Estate
        secondary_locality:
          type: string
          maxLength: 40
          minLength: 0
          description: |-
            Never present without a primary locality. The secondary locality has a wider geographic scope than the primary locality.

            It is the secondary locality therefore which differentiates addresses with the same primary locality name within the same county.

            Secondary localities are more likely to be required for rural addresses.

            Second locality elements which can refer to areas, districts, industrial estates, towns, etc

            The secondary locality helps identify where the primary locality is located.
          example: Manorhamilton

            Also known as the Post Town.

            The name of the post town associated with the premises for postal delivery purposes. This includes Dublin Postal Districts "Dublin 1" to "Dublin 24".

            The post town is a significant element of the Postal Address, however it is not always populated in an address. The official post office guide, Eolaí an Phoist4, describes post towns in the following manner:

            "A provincial postal address may include the name of a town or village several miles distant, with which the addressee has little or no connection, and, in some places, especially if this residence happens to be near a county boundary, the name of the neighbouring county instead of the county in which he actually resides. The explanation is that the main mail despatches have to be sent for more detailed sub division to certain centres known as POST TOWNS, chosen because of their accessibility and convenience."

          description: One of the 26 Counties in the Republic of Ireland. These counties are sub-national divisions used for the purposes of administrative, geographical and political demarcation. Post County is the County associated with the Post Town, not the geographic county in which the building is located. The Post County is normally used as part of the Postal Address with some exceptions e.g. Dublin Postal Districts where the Post County is not used and some Post Towns (e.g. Tipperary, Kildare, etc.) that have the same name as the Post County.

            The seven character Eircode has an A65 F4E2 format. The Eircode is a mandatory address element. The last line of a Postal Address will contain the Eircode, displayed with a space. e.g. `A65 F4E2`.

            The Eircode is always the last line of a Postal Address generated within the state, e.g. if an address has four lines then the Eircode will be on its own on Address Line 5. For inbound international mail the country name IRELAND should be appended as the last line of the Postal Address.

                The post town is a significant element of the Postal Address, however it is not always populated in an address. The official post office guide, Eolaí an Phoist1, describes post towns in the following manner:

                "A provincial postal address may include the name of a town or village several miles distant, with which the addressee has little or no connection, and, in some places, especially if this residence happens to be near a county boundary, the name of the neighbouring county instead of the county in which he actually resides. The explanation is that the main mail despatches have to be sent for more detailed sub division to certain centres known as post towns, chosen because of their accessibility and convenience."

                NUA means "non-unique address".

                The NUA field contains `true` when the address is a non-unique address, and `false` when it is a unique address.

                Ireland has a very high level of non-unique addresses (NUA), i.e. the address does not contain a unique building number or name. Approximately 35% of all Irish addresses are non-unique which equates to 600,000 addresses.

                The typical example of NUA addressing is where every address in a townland is the same. The way that post is delivered is by local knowledge of postal delivery personnel of which addressee lives in which house.

                N.B. For a NUA address, it is impossible to match to a unique record in the ECAD and assign an Eircode.

                Addresses points can assume one of the following values:

                - Residential Address Point. This type of address point has one residential addresses associated with it.
                - Non-Residential Address Point. This type of address point has one or more non-residential address (business, club or other organisation) associated with it.
                - Mixed Address Point. This is a special case where the residential and non residential addresses in the building are essentially the same address. The typical example is a farm house on an active farm. It is important to note that this is a special case. In general a building with both residential and non-residential addresses (e.g. an apartment over a shop) will receive two address points, one commercial and one residential, and hence two Eircodes.

                Buildings can contain multiple address points of type Residential and/or Non-Residential.
